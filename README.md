# JMU-CIS-484-Capstone-Project
This was my CIS 484 capstone project which was created for James Madison University's CyberDay.
This information system allows for event management for keeping track of guests, students, volunteers, coordinators, and teachers present for each event.
This solution has a default start page once it is run so it is not necessary to open a particular page. This version will run locally and was sucessfully adapted 
for use on an AWS EC2 instance.
